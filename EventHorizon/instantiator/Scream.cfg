    message = You appear to be Missing the INSTANTIATOR mod. While it isn't vital for Event Horizon to work, INSTANTIATOR is strongly required to utilise Murphs Accretion disk and lens. Both are the the whole reason why I revived this mod. So I'm gonna be real disappointed in you if you don't use INSTANTIATOR. Also I have no idea why this message is appearing twice.
