		AguaSrfLandedSouthContinent = You pick up a fancy rock. The KSC asks what its scientific relevance is. Having no good excuse, you put the rock back from where you got it. 
		AguaSrfLandedIslands = Certain concentrations of material suggest that this surface has only recently been uncovered from the ocean. It's littered with old organic material.
		AguaSrfSplashedDressianOceanDressianOcean = The sample contains a small amount of oxygen producing bacteria. Enough  to breath, but not yet enough to support permanent colonisation.
		
		AlgalSrfSplashedAlgeaSoup = The sample behaves more like a goo than water. Getting a sample had proven as rather difficult.  The majority of the goo seems to be made out of a single type of algae and little water.
		AlgalSrfLandedImpactCrater =-----
		AlgalSrfLandedGreenAlgeaLowlands = The sample features an unusually high concentration of Algae and various types of moss. 
		AlgalSrfLandedYellowAlgeaHighlands = The Algea and moss here is slightly more yellow than in the lowlands. This suggest that the conditions here are less optimal for indigenous plant growth.
		
		BrandSrfSplashedOcean = The sample is teeming  with various forms of microbiological life including a large number of oxygen producing bacteria.
		BrandSrfLandedGlacierHighlands = you pick up a chunk of Ice and consider if it would make for good crushed ice with syrup. Having packed no syrup or ice crusher, paired with the KSC's nagging, convinces you to store the ice sample instead of eating it.
		BrandSrfLandedKaedeMoutainridge = The dust is littered with a strange green crystalline substance. It makes you upset for unknown reasons..
		BrandSrfLandedNagisaMountains = There are small blue dust particles encased within the rocks here. There must be something more behind the simple blue appearance

		ComidaSrfLandedPolarFlats = You scoop up a but of ice. It softly glimmers in the faint starlight. You suspect
		ComidaSrfLandedKiwiFlats = Despite all contradicting evidence, the KSC staff is convinced that the Ice here must taste like kiwi. Unwillingly, you scoop up an extra bit of "samples".
		ComidaSrfLandedLesserFlats = The KSC insists on a surface sample, although you don't get why those flats are so important.
		ComidaSrfLandedSpotMountains = "I'm are the king of the world!" you think to yourself. Although it is more of a lump of ice.
		ComidaSrfLandedBlueMidlands = The Ice here has an unusually strong blue tone. The KSC yells at you to get back to work, instead of staring at a shiny rock.

		FuegoSrfLandedBurningBeach = The sample contains various types of fresh vulcanic rock. All of which are hot enough to melt the tupperware which you mistaklenly tried to substitute as sample canister.
		FuegoSrfLandedScorchedMidlands = Sample appears to be saturated with minerals and elements suitable for plant growth. To bad the rest of the planet isn't that inviting for plants.
		FuegoSrfLandedHighlands = Weather and time have removed a bit of the top layer of ash and vulcanic rock, enabling you to sample rocks which are a bit older than the fresh vulcanic rock.
		
		IzzettaSrfLandedStreemaCaters = You spend 15 minutes picking up several nice rocks, without packaging anything. After much frustration, you settle on the second one which you found.

		IzzettaSrfLandedTerrelImpactCraters = Solid vulcanic rock tells from a strong, ground shattering impact that must have happened here.
		IzzettaSrfLandedMiraMountains = The ground us littered with differently colored crystals. It kinda looks like the night sky, or candy sprinkles.
		IzzettaSrfLandedRaisaMainland = The sample has a strangely high concentration of hydrocarbons. Maybe it's even made out of cold peanut butter.
		
		KleinSrfLandedAsteroid  = Curiously, you pick up a rock and throw it as hard as you can too see how far it goes. You never see it land.
		KleinSrfLandedMetalCore = While attempting to gather a sample of the asteroids core, you accidentally let loose of the tool.  It flies for a few hundred meters before landing again. The KSC tells you to get it back again.
		
		LogosSrfSplashedOil = The seas here are made out of oil. would be really practical, If getting here or leaving wasn't such a pain.
		LogosSrfLandedGraphiteBeach = The sample reminds you of writing in school.
		LogosSrfLandedCoalLowlands = The rocks here have a striking resemblance to coal. To bad it's all trapped on here.

		Magia_MassoSrfLandedCrackedLowlands = Regular boring grey rocks, nothing else to see sample here.
		
		MirtSrfSplashedLivingValley = The water here is high on microorganisms and really small fish like creates. Might save some for the future.
		MirtSrfSplashedPolarOcean = You scoop up a bit of water and notice how it has an elevated salt content. Might be why it isn't frozen.
		MirtSrfLandedLiving Valley = The sample contains a high amount of photosynthesizing organic straws. Mission Control informs you that that is called "gras"
		MirtSrfLandedHighlands = You remind yourself that it is rock and sand, not cinnamon. Now hungry, stow away the sample.
		MirtSrfLandedCliffsofMorath = You find an unusually shaped blue crystal among the stone. Maybe the R&D knows what to do with it.
		MirtSrfLandedDustyLowlands = you try to pick up a bit of dust, but the windy weather keeps stealing it out of your shovel. You still manage to get a bit after a few frustrating minutes.
		
		NotGUNovusSrfLandedScorchedSea = You find a few roundes pepples. Analysis of their composition tells that they are the kind that can only be found on dried river/lake beds.
		NotGUNovusSrfLandedBurningLowlands = Samples contain a high concentration of Iron, giving it its red color.
		NotGUNovusSrfLandedSearingHighlands = The rocks here have been weathered from stellar radiation. 
		
		OntosSrfLandedNorthernOcean = The dust here is highly energized, as If you something is concentrating power here.
		OntosSrfLandedSilentLowlands = You want to think that the rocks taste like hazelnut chocolate, but they probably only taste like pain.
		OntosSrfLandedSerenePlains = You find regular  patterns of burned glass, almost as If some kind of powerful engine has burned them.
		OntosSrfLandedPeacefullHighlands = As you examine the rock, you notice how calm it is here compared to Klaus other Planets.
		
		PneumaSrfSplashedDriedIron-pentacarbonylLakes =AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
		PneumaSrfLandedDriedIron-pentacarbonylLakes = As you scoop up a bit of dust, your equipment starts to melt. Maybe plastic toy shovels weren't the best idea to use here.
		PneumaSrfLandedSizzlingLowLands = You pick a chunk of metal. High pressure and temperatues have weathered it to a round-ish shape.
		PneumaSrfLandedUnedendingMajorScar = The sample contains a trace amount of iron crystals
		PneumaSrfLandedMinorScars = The sample has a higher iron density than is normal. Some strong forces must have been at work.
		PneumaSrfLandedTremendousHighlands = The rocks here are a bit rougher and sharper here. Weathering forces must not be as strong as in the lowlands.
		
		RomillySrfSplashedMeridianOcean = The sea is made out of regular seawater. A slightly elevated salt content, but nothing compared to laythe.
		RomillySrfLandedIledeglaceIslands = 
		RomillySrfLandedPatodeHieloIsland = As you pick up a sample, communication channels get flooded by R&D researchers, having a heated debate about laser sails and solar sails. Distracted by it, you forget to examine the sample. 
		RomillySrfLandedArcticLowlands = The sample consists mostly of waterice and a bit of gravel. A snowball fight might not be the best idea.
