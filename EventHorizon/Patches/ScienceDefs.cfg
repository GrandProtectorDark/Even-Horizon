		AguaSrfLandedSouthContinent = You pick up a fancy rock. The KSC asks what its scientific relevance is. Having no good excuse, you put the rock back from where you got it. 
		AguaSrfLandedIslands = Certain concentrations of material suggest that this surface has only recently been uncovered from the ocean. It's littered with old organic material.
		AguaSrfSplashedDressianOcean = The sample contains a small amount of oxygen producing bacteria. Enough  to breath, but not yet enough to support permanent colonisation.
		
		AlgalSrfSplashedAlgeaSoup = The sample behaves more like a goo than water. Getting a sample had proven as rather difficult.  The majority of the goo seems to be made out of a single type of algae and little water.

		MirtSrfSplashedLivingValley = The water here is high on microorganisms and really small fish like creates. Might save some for the future.
		MirtSrfSplashedPolarOcean = You scoop up a bit of water and notice how it has an elevated salt content. Might be why it isn't frozen.
		MirtSrfLandedLiving Valley = The sample contains a high amount of photosynthesizing organic straws. Mission Control informs you that that is called "gras"
		MirtSrfLandedHighlands = You remind yourself that it is rock and sand, not cinnamon. Now hungry, stow away the sample.

		OntosSrfLandedSilentLowlands = You want to think that the rocks taste like hazelnut chocolate, but they probably only taste like pain.
		OntosSrfLandedSerenePlains = You find regular  patterns of burned glass, almost as If some kind of powerful engine has burned them.
		OntosSrfLandedPeacefullHighlands = As you examine the rock, you notice how calm it is here compared to Klaus other Planets.
		
		PneumaSrfSplashedDriedIron-pentacarbonylLakes =AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
		PneumaSrfLandedDriedIron-pentacarbonylLakes = As you scoop up a bit of dust, your equipment starts to melt. Maybe plastic toy shovels weren't the best idea to use here.
		PneumaSrfLandedSizzlingLowLands = You pick a chunk of metal. High pressure and temperature have weathered it to a round-ish shape.
		PneumaSrfLandedUnedendingMajorScar = The sample contains a trace amount of iron crystals
		PneumaSrfLandedMinorScars = The sample has a higher iron density than is normal. Some strong forces must have been at work.
		PneumaSrfLandedTremendousHighlands = The rocks here are a bit rougher and sharper here. Weathering forces must not be as strong as in the lowlands.

		RomillySrfLandedIledeglaceIslands = 
		RomillySrfLandedPatodeHieloIsland = As you pick up a sample, communication channels get flooded by R&D researchers, having a heated debate about laser sails and solar sails. Distracted by it, you forget to examine the sample.

		AguaSrfSplashedDressianOcean = This ocean is useless for anything but creating depth. 

		AguaFlyingLowIslands = Those Islands maybe make for a temporary maritime-laboratory base. But storms might pose a problem, here at open sea.
		AguaFlyingLowDressianOceanDressianOcean = There isn't much noteworthy about those oceans, they look the same as on Laythe. Did we actually leave kerbol?

		AlgalInSpaceHigh = The surface looks.... green. Is this gras and foliage, or...?
		
		BrandSrfSplashedOcean = I think I spilled a water supply-package.
		BrandSrfLandedGlacierHighlands = It looks pretty icy outside. Let's hope this EVA suit is somewhat slip resistant

		FuegoSrfLandedBurningBeach = IT feels like an oven in here.
		FuegoSrfLandedScorchedMidlands = Why did the KSC send a manned mission to Novus, but forgets to add a proper AC that can deal with the proximity to Cooper.
		FuegoSrfLandedHighlands = I can't tell what's worse. Being cooked alive or being half a galaxy away from the next plate of Spaghettieis
		FuegoInSpaceLow = Fuego doesn't look that friendly from up close. Seas of hot molten Rock instead of Water lakes. Why should we go down there.
		FuegoInSpaceHigh = You really hope those dark red lakes are spicy salsa and not something more deadly.
		
		IzzettaSrfLandedStreemaCaters = Should be leave the safe capsule? I don't know. Let's stay inside where it is comfortable.

		LogosSrfSplashedOil = Who turned the lights off.
		LogosSrfLandedGraphiteBeach = Writing a report turns into an exercise down here. Everything is 3 times heavier. Even the cumbersome suit isn't helping either.
		LogosSrfLandedCoalLowlands = Everything feels so heavy here. It's barely possible to lift an arm without being reminded back to the GYM sessions from the training camp.
		LogosSrfLandedDiamondHills = Everything hurths. Why did the could the KSC not send an unmanned probe instead of sending crew. Too much gravity.
		LogosInSpaceLow = Darkness below and Above, why isn't it more colorful
		LogosInSpaceHigh = Logos kinda reminds you of an edgy version of Eve.

		MagisterSrfLandedGreylands = Are we back at home? Wait, did the Mun always have green rings?
		MagisterSrfLandedDustRegions = Everywhere you touch, you get a static shock. As if something energetic is charging the metal of the craft. 
		MagisterInSpaceLow = There's something strange about those green spots on Magister. Maybe we should investigate it.

		NotGUNovusSrfLandedBurningLowlands = Lets hope the the capsules temperature regulation can deal with Novus intense temperatures.
		NotGUNovusSrfLandedSearingHighlands = Novus being tidally locked doesn't really help with the temperatures. The night side is cool... but also dark. It's possible to see something in the day side, but the intense sunlight doesn't make it a walk in the park either.
		NotGUNovusInSpaceLow = You can clearly see that Novus must once have been More similar to Kerbin or Eve. Something kicked it too close to Cooper. But what.

		PneumaSrfLandedTremendousHighlands = One could mean that being higher up makes gravity a little bit weaker. Doesn't help on Pneuma. 
		PneumaInSpaceLow = Pneuma looks even more terrifying from Close up. you really don't like the thought of having to go down there. 
		PneumaInSpaceHigh = High gravity: Check! Thick Atmosphere: Check! Both Worse than on Eve: Check!

		RomillySrfLandedRockyHighlands = Lets hope the Onboard-Observation-Computer doesn't explode when you want to access your environmental records.
		RomillyInSpaceLow = The KSC gets really anxious about the Airlocks. They almost frantically ask you to Check all docking ports and Airlocks for any potential of Failure. And don't let the scientist get close to them.
		RomillyInSpaceHigh = Romilly looks like a big Snowball from up here.
		
		WolfSrfLandedCopper-sulfateDeposits = Everything looks so blue outside, did we land underwater?

		WolfInSpaceLow = The Blue spots are rather intriguing and interesting. Other than that it looks like a more dark-grey-ish Mun
		WolfInSpaceHigh = It somehow looks a lot less cratered than it should be. Maybe it is geologically active?
		
		Anomaly-WH-35325-AInSpace = A hole? A sphere of nothing? The Guys at the KSC think that is it probably safe to travel through the anomaly. But they did warn you not to get to close to it. Something about bent spacetime only being stable enough for travel around a small area above its "surface". They used a lot of big words, so you aren't sure.
		Anomaly-WH-35325-BInSpace = After what felt like an eternity, you notice that you aren't dead. After a lengthy celebration, you notice that there is something wrong with the star. it Looks unusually dark.... \\nn\\nn The KSC informed you that that is called a black hole.
		Anomaly-WH-17823-C-1InSpace = Another Anomaly. Maybe there's another star system connect to it, like some kind of network. The KSC urges you to find it out.
		Anomaly-WH-17823-C-2InSpace = After getting free from a mildly annoying headache, you notice that you made it through again without dying. It is safe to say that those Anomalies can indeed be used for crewed travel, Properly.
		Anomaly-WH-17823-D-1InSpace = Another Anomaly!, but this one gives off some strange feeling, as if something not so desirable lies beyond it. The KSC urges you to go through it anyway.
		Anomaly-WH-17823-D-2InSpace = After a heavy case of nausea, you notice the slight blue tint that everything has now. Something rather bright and blue is illuminating the sky
		
		NjordInSpace = Njord looks like as if someone had took Jool and painted it blue. But it appears to be a lot smaller.
		MurphInSpace = Even with the limited view from out of the capsule, Murph looms in the sky, giving of a awe inspiring aura.
		CooperInSpace = Something about looking out of the window gives of a familiar feeling of home.

		FuegoSrfLandedBurningBeach = The instruments informs you that it does not like being here and prefers not to be used near active lava lakes.
		FuegoSrfLandedScorchedMidlands = The instrument detects high concentrations of ash, little bit of sulphur and lots of Co2. Sounds like volcanism to me.
		FuegoSrfLandedHighlands = The device detects gases typical for volcanic areas.
		
		
		LogosSrfLandedGraphiteBeach =  The scoop appears to be clogged by something. The instrument detects small fumes emitted by it and categorizes it as "oil".
		LogosSrfLandedCoalLowlands = The instrument reads a high concentration of coal dust. Let's hope it doesn't clog the scoop.
		LogosSrfLandedDiamondHills = The atmosphere contains crystaline carbon and metal. The later may originate from the device itself being damaged by the sharp diamond dust.

		AguaSrfLanded =  The ground has a poor fertility but might still be able to grow crops. The atmosphere is definitely breathable, a bit cold but not too bad.
		AguaInSpace  =  A world similar to laythe, but with a lot more land, although few is located near the tropical regions. If there happens to be oxygen, then it might be a good choice to settle here.      
		
		AlgalSrfLanded =  Good news: You CAN breath this atmosphere. Bad news: It is saturated with toxic algae and extreme humidity. So is the Water and the ground. It might be possible to send out terraforming domes. But don't put your money on that.
		AlgalInSpace = It looks really green from up here. REALLY green. Algal is a little larger than Kerbin and has a suitable atmosphere. It might even be possible to breath there.
		
		BrandSrfLanded = The air is rather dry, but surprisingly breathable. The ground might even be able to grow crops! The desert temperatures might make habitation not that pleasant though.
		BrandInSpace  = Brand is only a little bit smaller than Kerbin and its atmosphere looks rather promising. It also had great bodies of liquid water. Despite that, it appears to be rather arid and dry, similar to our deserts.
		
		ComidaSrfLanded = Comida has a high concentration of water ice, that might come in handy. otherwise it has no use for colonists.
		ComidaInSpace  = No atmosphere and low gravity. Rather unsuitable for permanent habitation.
		
		DoyleSrfLanded  = The land is infertile and the water is sterile. Neither has the air any breathable oxygen. Only redeeming quality might be the view. 
		DoyleInSpace  = Doyle is a laythe like world. A vast planet wide ocean covered in Islands. It's atmosphere is a bit thicker than the one from Home and the gravity is quite a bit higher, but it might be a promising Colonie candidate.
		
		FuegoSrfLanded  = Boiling temperatures and a toxic, volcanic atmosphere. Lakes and seas of Lava. This is not a great place to live. 
		FuegoInSpace =  The thick atmosphere might serve good shelter from radiation and asteroids. But It might be easier and better to choose Agua.
		
		IzzettaSrfLanded  = Izetta has decent concentrations of usable Ore deposits. Ideal  for a mining colony. The lack of atmosphere and low gravity makes it unsuitable for permanent Civilian Colonies.
		IzzettaInSpace =  Izetta is comparable to Ike or Dres in size and gravity. It doesn't have any atmosphere either
		
		KleinSrfLanded  = The gravity is too low to live here. Please don't

		LogosSrfLanded = Painful high gravity: Check. Unbreathable atmosphere: Check. Unbelievable pressure and temperatures: also check. 
		LogosInSpace = Logos Thick atmosphere might come in handy to shield from Klaus High radiation. No bodies of Liquid water an be found, nor does the Atmosphere look promising.
		
		MagisterSrfLanded  = Ike like gravity and no atmosphere. The ground also emits a strange kind of energy with unknown effects on Kerbals. Might not be a good idea to settle here.
		MagisterInSpace  =  Similar in size to Ike. Doesn't have an atmosphere and is within Murphs asteroid cloud. Probably a bad idea to settle here.
		
		Magia_MassoSrfLanded  = No protection from space debris or radiation and a strange energy emitted by the stone. Permanent colonisation is advised against. 
		Magia_MassoInSpace  =  Magia is a tiny Minmus sized stone walnut. The low gravity might prove rather unsuitable for comfortable habitation.

		MirtInSpace =  Mirt is somewhat similar to duna, but it does have oceans. Its shores look somewhat alive, which might point at a breathable atmosphere.
		
		NotGUNovusSrfLanded = The lack of atmosphere and water makes this a poor choice for any Colonists. Other than the view of Cooper, there isn't a reason to actually settle here.
		NotGUNovusInSpace = Novus has the right size, but sadly no Atmosphere or water. Its proximity to Cooper also isn't pleasant either.
		
		OntosSrfLanded =  Ontos generates a harmfull amout of data-noise. Aside from being an airless planet unsuitable for life, it is also unsuitable for anything digital.
		OntosInSpace  =  This planet has no atmosphere whatsoever and a gravitational pull similar to the one of the Mun. Ontos might be suitable as mining Colonie, but not for permanent Habitation.

		RomillyInSpace  =  Romilly has a thick atmosphere that might serve well to protect from asteroid impacts and radiation and doesn't require vacuum rated pressure suits. However no conformation of the presence of oxygen.
		
		WolfSrfLanded  = Wolf has decent concentrations of usable Ore deposits. Ideal for a mining colony. The lack of atmosphere and low gravity makes it unsuitable for permanent Civilian Colonies.

		NjordInSpace = We may be possible to set up Cloud cities on Njord. But it might be easier to set up base on one of its moons.
		MurphInSpace = This is a black hole. Why are you doing a Habitability Assessment for a black hole. Are you delusional? Do you need to go to the infirmary?
		CooperInSpace =  This star is stable in energy output and has a decent lifespan. We can't colonise the star itself however.
