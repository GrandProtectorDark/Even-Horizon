			description = Following the discovery of a Werner-Rosen, which was found in Low orbit around Jool, Astronomers around the globe where baffled to find a massive Black-hole at the other end. One of our Pilots suggested to name it "Murph"(after his daughter), which became its official naming as no one proposed a better name for it. The first Mission send to Murph, was the Jool-Anomaly-Exploration-Telescope, a long range, Ion Propelled deep space telescope. The JAET has since its installation discovered several dozen Exoplanets and 2 confirmed Stars orbiting Murph. Further investigation has shown that several of those planets appear to have potential for permanent Colonisation. Although the R&D is unsure which ones definitely are habitable and which not.
