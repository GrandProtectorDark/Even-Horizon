# Event-Horizon 
A KSP Planet Addon offering a star system, loosly inspired by the movie interstellar.

This deversion requires the following dependencies:

https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases

https://github.com/StollD/KopernicusExpansion-Continued/releases 
(KEX-EVAFootprints and KEX-Wormholes)
https://github.com/Galileo88/Community-Terrain-Texture-Pack/releases 

https://spacedock.info/mod/1624/INSTANTIATOR (Required for the blackhole)

As of this time, this planet pack is still incomplete. Unforseen issue may still find themself here.

Event Horizon uses a new feature which was Introduced in Kopernicus Expansion in ksp version 1.4.2, which enables us (planet pack creators) to make functional end to end wormholes.

How to use the wormholes:
Be In orbit around the Anomalie.
Lower your Periapsis to be within 0 - 7.7km
Wait till reaching periapsis.

If continous watersplashing sounds occur then you know it is working.
That a jump occured makes itself known by the giant lagspike that gets created by being transported  halfway across spacetime.
